- 👋 Hi, I’m @valeril1s
- 👀 I’m interested in learning something new!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS, Java, SQL and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with crazy and creative workaholics. 
- 📫 How to reach me? You won't know, I'm like the corpse of a dead bride. (P.s. btw it's a great cartoon)
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: my moles on my left cheek are arranged in the shape of the constellation Ursa Major.
